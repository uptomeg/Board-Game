Goal: We want every group member to work on at least part of the code and have a total of 6 user stories/design patterns done by the end of this sprint.

A current assessment of team capacity: We have worked together before, so we think we can make it in time for all of the deliverables for this sprint.

Participation breakdown:
1)safe initializaion(story & new decision): Andrey Valkov will implement the singleton pattern for the ThreeMusketeers class. The idea behind this is that it will allow for easier extension of that class when a future developer comes  along and decides to implement multiplayer features.

2)user login(story & new decision):Chutong Li will implement the user login feature by the visitor pattern. The idea behind this is that it will allow the assigned user to login and read the data from the given source file.

3)robot help moving(story): Chiung-Li Wang  will implement the robot help moving feature. The idea behind this is that when user have no idea to decide how they move in their turn, the robot will help him decide.

4)presentation work: Zhanteng Zhang will do the presentation demo and the orginization of the presenation, which will combine the group numbers' recording and a clear powerpoint. 

5)debug and patching: Zhanteng Zhang will do the debug and patching, to fix the errors which may exist in our a3 works.
