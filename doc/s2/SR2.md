unfinished tasks: 
	none



What are some good practices that helped you during this sprint?
	
	Work separately and work as a whole group are both important. Work separately to make it more efficient and help other group members when they meet some problems that they can not solve by themselves. 
	
	Some git flow knowledge that we learn from the group work or online. We were not good at pull requests at first, but after sprint2, we are familiar with it and used it in a good way.


What are some new practices that you might want to employ during your next project?
	
	make a time plan to help the progress run well instead of rushing in the end.

	Reasonable division of tasks, promptly report to others if there is a problem instead of spending a lot of time trying to figure it out by yourself.


What are (if any) harmful practices that hurt the progression of this sprint?

	Timely communication is very important, not only to prevent different people from doing the same job or fixing the same bug. At the same time, each team member can clearly understand the progress and completion of the project. Less communication and communication will only slow down the progress of the project

What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2?
	
	We really feel the importance of learning from each other, because we also need to use some design patterns outside the classroom. When some team members can't understand a new design pattern, group members will help each other to learn new stuff. It is a great experience to learn and understand new knowledge during the group assignment.
