Sprint1:

Goal: we want every group member to work on at least one user story so that we can have at least 4 user stories done for this sprint.

a current assessment of team capacity: we have not worked together before and it is our first time working together So we think we can make 4 user stories done in this sprint (in one week ) and finish the rest in the next sprint.

Stories and Decision:
1)dangerous sign(story): Chiung-Li Wang will work on this user story, and we donâ€™t make any changes on this user story. So he will implement this function as the description in the designpattern.pdf and productBacklog.csv.



2)new bot agent(story & new decision): Zhanteng Zhang will work on this user story, and we will change it a little bit. To make more connection between different functions, instead of using the number of games that user has played, the difficulty level is changed depending on the round number which the round count function can provide. We also changed this part in the designpattern.pdf.



3)the round count(story & new decision):Chutong Li will work on this user story, and this is the new function that we add in this sprint. Because we learned a new design pattern, iterator pattern,  this week, we decided to add this new design pattern in our game to implement the round count feature. We have added this new design pattern in the designpattern.pdf.


4) Remove the MVC pattern and give up the UI part(new decision): after connecting with our mentor TA, we decide to give up the UI part and use another design pattern instead of the MVC pattern. Since we have done the UI in the assignment 2 and it becomes less meaningful for us to repeat this part again, we just give up this part and remove MVC pattern in the designpattern.pdf.

5) Re-Implement Undo Feature in a More Scalable Way: Andrey Valkov will implement the undo feature using the memento design pattern to allow for easier refactoring and modification of undo in the future. The changes will mostly be in ThreeMusketeers.java and Board.java.
